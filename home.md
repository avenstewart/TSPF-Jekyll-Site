It's been far too long since you last visited! Over 10 years, to be precise.
I wonder if you remember the last time you walked the halls of The Science Place...<br><br>

Well, you're here now - that's what matters. Now we can pick right back up where you left off.
Let's see, what was it? The robot dinosaurs, or The Electric Theatre?
Perhaps you were busy controlling the hot air balloon, or maybe the giant

<br><br> In that case, I suppose we'll just have to take you <a href="/history">back in time...</a></p>
