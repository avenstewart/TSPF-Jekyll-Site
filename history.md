## 1936 - The Texas Centennial Exposition

The Centennial Exposition was a world's fair held within Fair Park from June 6th to November 29th, 1936. As a 
celebration of the 100th anniversary of Texas's Independence from Mexico, 50 buildings were constructed on the fair 
grounds. Among them were three buildings which would later become the collective museums of The Science Place. They 
would take on various names over the coming years, but at the time, these were the 
Dallas Museum of Natural History, The Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, and the Domestic Arts building. 
All of these structures were designed by a group of architects headed by George Dahl, in the Art Deco architectural style.

## 1946 - The Dallas Health Museum

On October 5th, 1949, the Dallas Health Museum premiered as a 
revolutionary public institution entirely devoted to the Health sciences. This museum was housed within the former 
Domestic Arts building, which would later become known as Science Place II. This museum is often noted as being the 
precursor to The Science Place, and was one of only two of its kind in the nation. We have a large number of photographs
from this era, but verifiable information can be hard to come by.

## 1953 - The Planetarium

Originally opened within an auditorium of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts in October 1953, The Planetarium at Fair 
Park was World Class. Originally featuring a Spitz Model A-1 Planetarium projector, the program operated in this building until 
1956, when it was moved into the Dallas Health Museum facility where it would stay for the remaining 56 years of its history.

## 1986 - The Science Place

In 1986, the science & nature museums at fair park consolidated to form The Science Place. The first major exhibition,
"China: 7000 Years of Discovery", marks the beginning of this era and the innovative educational endeavors that shaped 
the future of Dallas. Other significant exhibits during this period include the very first life-size animatronic
dinosaurs. The majority of these exhibitions were displayed in the former Museum of Fine Arts, which was renamed as
Science Place I. We are still discovering new things about this time period every day, but much of the 80's remains to be rediscovered.

## 1996 - T.I. Founders IMAX Theater

This year marked the construction and expansion of Science Place I. Often referred to as "The Palazzo", this addition 
included a state-of-the-art IMAX Theatre, as well as a beautiful solar system floor which remains there to this day. 
During this time, we also see a revitalization of The Science Place branding to feature the familiar "stars and planets" 
and "T.I. Founders" tagline. 

## 2007 - The Museum of Nature and Science

In 2007 we see the acquisition and subsequent rebranding of The Science Place to become The Museum of Nature & Science.
During this period, we start to see the museums embrace digital media; historical materials from this period are 
far easier to come by as a result. From this point on the museums would undergo large scale reorganization of various 
collections, as well as several new travelling exhibits, while a new facility was constructed in downtown Dallas as
part of a cultural consolidation effort. The final exhibition shown in Science Place I was 
"Planet Shark", which ran from October 31st, 2011, to August 14th, 2012. At this time, all museum property and contents 
were moved to the new facility downtown, and all former Science Place buildings remain closed to this day.

## 2012 to Present - The Perot Museum of Nature and Science

As the final evolution of The Science Place, The Perot museum represents the culmination of over 75 years of dedicated 
work by countless individuals and organizations to create the museum of the future. It remains in operation to this day 
and boasts an incredible array of interactive exhibits and collections.
