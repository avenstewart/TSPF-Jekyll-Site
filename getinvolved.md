## Membership

We would love to have you join the foundation. You can become a member of the foundation by reaching out to us via the 
<a href="/contact" >contact page.</a> At this time, we don't have a way to process memberships on our website, 
but we're working on it!

## Submissions
You can help us build the archives by submitting your own photos, videos, documents, or personal experiences from
The Science Place. We are always looking for new materials to add to our collections. We also accept physical 
"artifacts", as well as original gift shop items. Anyone who contributes to our archives will be added to 
the public list of contributors <a href="/contributors">here</a>.

## Donate
Our foundation is currently accepting financial donations, though we are still working on our payment portal. 
Please reach out to us directly if you would like more information on donating.

## Volunteer
We need all the help we can get, particularly with digitizing physical items, as well as collection documentation. 
If you would like to volunteer, please let us know.
